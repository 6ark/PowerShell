If you are using Active Directory you can use Get-ADComputer instead of referencing a text file, like in $Computers. (Guide: https://adamtheautomator.com/get-adcomputer/)

Edit: I forgot to apply a filter to the list of computer names. He can do something like;
$Computers = Get-Content "C:\temp\computers.txt" | Foreach-Object {$_ | Where-Object -like "*HR*ROD*" }
NOTE1: I probably used the wrong operator, you can find information on operators here; https://www.educba.com/powershell-operators/?source=leftnav
NOTE2: You may need to pipe the results of computers after filtering it again to an updated text file (e.g. "C:\temp\computers_updated.txt")
